teamtreehouse - project - #2
1. Pagination Link and a Searchable Form project
2. The requirement for this project is to use only Vanilla or pure JavaScript
   and to also use a modern web development techniques like Unobtrusive JavaScript 
   and Progressive Enhancement.
 
 Below are the functions that are used in this project
 * The showPage() -- this function is used to show a maximun of 10 items per page
 * The appendPageLinks() -- this function add pagination links to the page dynamically
   every time the showPage function is called.
 * The searchInputValue() -- this function filters any user name that match a search when pressing the keys on the keyboard.
 
Below are some of the features that I implemented in this project
 * The DOMContentLoaded method -- this method is use to prevent a commom bugs in the project when 
   other Developers remove the javaScript file from the buttom and place it in the head of the page.
 * I also implemented that when the user make an invalid search, the extra invalid value will be 
   shown or display to the user. This will give the user a clear understanding of what is going on in the 
   search form.
